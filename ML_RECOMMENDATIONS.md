# ü§ñ Machine Learning Recommendation System

## Overview

This auto parts e-commerce platform now includes a sophisticated **Machine Learning Recommendation System** that provides personalized product recommendations to users based on their behavior and preferences.

## üß† AI Features

### 1. **Content-Based Filtering**
- **Algorithm**: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) + Cosine Similarity
- **Features**: Product names, descriptions, and categories
- **Purpose**: Recommends products similar to what users have viewed or purchased
- **Implementation**: `recommendation_system.get_content_based_recommendations()`

### 2. **Collaborative Filtering**
- **Algorithm**: Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
- **Features**: User purchase history and ratings
- **Purpose**: Finds users with similar preferences and recommends products they liked
- **Implementation**: `recommendation_system.get_collaborative_recommendations()`

### 3. **Hybrid Recommendations**
- **Algorithm**: Weighted combination of content-based and collaborative filtering
- **Weights**: 60% collaborative + 40% content-based
- **Purpose**: Combines the best of both approaches for optimal recommendations
- **Implementation**: `recommendation_system.get_hybrid_recommendations()`

### 4. **Popular Products**
- **Algorithm**: Purchase frequency analysis
- **Purpose**: Shows trending products based on sales data
- **Implementation**: `recommendation_system.get_popular_products()`

### 5. **Category-Based Recommendations**
- **Algorithm**: Category filtering
- **Purpose**: Suggests products from the same category
- **Implementation**: `recommendation_system.get_category_based_recommendations()`
